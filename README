Weather::WMO is a module for parsing WMO abbreviated header lines
in World Meterological Organization-formatted weather products (such
as might come from the National Weather Service).

Aside from simple validation and parsing of header the lines (for
example, "FPUS61 KNYC 103055") this module doesn't do much else, but it
is used for the modules Weather::Product and Weather::Product::NWS

Required Modules:
	Carp
